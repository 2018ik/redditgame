# Reddit-AJAX

This is a Reddit guessing game where the top 100 posts for the past hour of four similar image-based subreddits: "aww" "mildlyinteresting" "funny" and "pics" are scraped and the user tries to guess which subreddit the image is from.

The user gets 10 points for each correct guess, and -5 points for seeing the title.
The score is reset when the image is guessed incorrectly, however the image is not and the user gets to guess again.
